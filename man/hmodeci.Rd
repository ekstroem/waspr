\title{Find the highest density interval.}
\usage{
hmodeci(x, cip)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a  sample from which to estimate the interval}

\item{cip}{bandwidth for the algorithm, ranging from 0 to 1}
}
\value{
a vector of length 2 containing the lower and upper bound of the HPD interval.

The bandwidth \code{cip} is set to 0.95 to find the 95% HPD interval and to 0.1 to compute the mode.
}
\description{
Find the highest density interval.
